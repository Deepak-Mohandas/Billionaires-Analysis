# Billionaires Analysis with Python

The dataset that I am using to analyze the data about billionaires around the world was curated by Forbes and is downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about global billionaires in 2021, including their:

    Names
    Net Worth 
    Country 
    Source 
    Rank
    Age
    Industry


you can find patterns among billionaires around the world to analyze the business environment of countries. 

The success of a business or startup depends a lot on the business environment of a country.

According to this analysis **United States and China are the countries from which most people become billionaires.**  So that means the **business environment and the startup success rate is really good in the US and China compared to the rest of the world.**









## Conclusion

The success of a business or startup depends a lot on the business environment of a country.

At the end of the analysis of global billionaires, I found that China and the United States are the countries with the most billionaires which concludes that the business environment and the success rate of a startup is much better in the US and China than in the rest of the world.
